# Asterisk Patch

This repository contains patches for Asterisk that add support for
the features needed by Cisco Enterprise IP Phones. Only the latest
version of the patches should be used, the older versions are kept
here for historical reference.

Patches are only created for LTS versions of Asterisk.

See [Patching Asterisk](http://usecallmanager.nz/patching-asterisk.html)
for more information.

`chan_sip` was removed from the official Asterisk source in version 22 so
that version of the patch also contains a modernised version of the channel
driver.

As part of the version 22 some features have been removed as they are either
not supported by Cisco phones, are obsolete or are almost never enabled. See
[Version 22 ChangeLog](#Version-22-ChangeLog) for the full list.

**Note**: The patch for Asterisk 22 is currently in development and may not 
be suitable for production use.
